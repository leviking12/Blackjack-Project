# Blackjack

## Description

- Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game where players try to get a hand closer to 21 than the dealer without going over: 
- Objective of the game, the player is trying to get a higher card total than the dealer, but not more than 21. 
- Playing cards, the face card values of Jack, Queen, King are worth 10, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 and are only able to save you one time before busting, and all other number cards are worth their face value. 
- Dealing cards, Players will receive their cards face up, and are given 2 cards at the start of the game, and the dealer's first card is placed face up and the second card is face down. 
- Playing, Players can choose to "hit" or "stand" after receiving their first two cards. To "hit", tap the hit button to receive more cards. To "stand", means to wave off your hand, and ends your turn.
- Win, lose and tie scenarios, If you're closer to 21 than the dealer or hit 21 exactly, you win. If the dealer goes over 21 and "busts", you also win. If you have less than 21 and less than the value of the dealer then you lose. If you go over the value of 21 and "bust", you also lose. If the value of your cards and the dealer cards is exactly the same then it ends in a tie.
